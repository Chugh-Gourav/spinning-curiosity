# VOTTAM 🥗
**(Value-Optimized Transparent Trading AI Manager)**

> **The intelligent shopping companion that democratizes access to healthy, sustainable, and affordable food.**

VOTTAM is a prototype AI agent designed to solve the "Health vs. Price" dilemma. It combines nutritional science (Yuka-style scoring) with price-performance metrics ("Smart Value") and Generative AI to help users make better food choices instantly.

---

## 🎯 The Problem
- **Confusion**: Nutritional labels are hard to read. Is "low fat" actually healthy?
- **Price Sensitivity**: Healthy food is perceived as expensive. 
- **Decision Fatigue**: Too many options, too little time.

## 💡 The Solution
1. **Instant Clarity**: Traffic-light health scores (0-100) for immediate understanding.
2. **Smart Swaps**: One-click suggestions for healthier *and* cheaper alternatives.
3. **AI Personalization**: Context-aware nudges based on user goals (e.g., "High sugar is risky for your Keto diet").

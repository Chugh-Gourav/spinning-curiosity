FRIEND FEEDBACK MESSAGE:
------------------------
Hey! I built a prototype called VOTTAM - Yuka is the main competitor, but I'm thinking about the positioning. Can you try it and give me honest feedback?

Try searching for "oatly" or "peanut butter", toggle AI Search, and tell me: What's useful? What's confusing? What would make you actually use this?
